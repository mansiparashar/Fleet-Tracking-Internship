# Summer Internship under RYD

Worked on 2 main projects

## Fleet Tracking System

A system created to make it easy for a company to track the fleets registered under them and also track functionalities like Distance travelled, fuel consumption, repair costs, approaching renewal dates etc

We made use of 
* HTML/CSS/JS/Bootsrap, with leaflet.js, chart.js for an interactive dashboard
* Django for the backend
* ML Algorithm for predicting various classes
